2. [K-means Clustering](#k-means-clustering)
3. [Logistic Regression and SVM](#logistic-regression-and-svm)
4. [Data Prediction](#data-prediction)

### Iris Data Visualization

This project provides tools for visualizing the famous Iris dataset using Python and Matplotlib.

#### Key Features:
- Interactive selection of features to plot
- Scatter plot visualization with different colors and markers for each Iris species
- Option to create multiple plots in a single session

### K-means Clustering

This project implements the K-means clustering algorithm and visualizes the results.

#### Key Features:
- K-means clustering implementation
- Visualization of clustered data points
- Computation of overall error (cost function J)

### Logistic Regression and SVM

This project implements logistic regression and compares it with Support Vector Machines (SVM) using different kernels.

#### Key Features:
- Logistic regression with gradient descent
- SVM classification using different kernels
- Data preprocessing: polynomial feature generation and feature scaling
- Model evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
- Visualization of decision boundaries

### Data Prediction

This project focuses on data prediction, likely using regression techniques to forecast future values based on historical data.

#### Key Features:
- Data reading from files
- Implementation of various regression models (linear, quadratic, cubic, fourth-degree)
- Cross-validation for model evaluation
- Visualization of error curves
- Prediction of future values
